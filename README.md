# Hack4Amrita
Hack4Amrita is an initiative by members of FOSS@Amrita club with a goal to solve real-world problems faced by Amritians, by innovating feasiable solutons through Hackathons. 

### How it works?
1. Students/Faculty (or other stakeholders) in the campus raise an issue that they are facing.
2. Developers of FOSS@Amrita (and other interested developers) team up for a Hackathon, and try solving the issues.
3. Feasible and Innovative solutions are presented to the Management, and implemented.
4. Issue resolved, everyone is happier.

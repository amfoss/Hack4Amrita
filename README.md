# Hack4Amrita
Hack4Amrita is a initiative by members of FOSS@Amrita club with a goal to solve real-world problems faced by Amritians, by innovating feasiable solutons through Hackathons. 

### How it works?
1. Students/Faculty (or other stakeholders) in the campus raise an issue they are facing.
2. Developers of FOSS@Amrita (and other interested developers) team up for an Hackathon, and try solving the issues.
3. Feasible and Innovative solutions are presented to the Management, and implemented.
4. Issue resolved, everyone is happier.
